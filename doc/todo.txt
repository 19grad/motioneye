-> make camera frames positions configurable
-> add a view log functionality

-> optimize the media list js code:
    * loading many media groups (directories) is painfully slow
    * scroll event could also be optimized for speed
-> style scroll bars
-> hint text next to section titles
-> clickable hints

-> implement working schedule (add another combo deciding what to do during working schedule)
-> implement notifications
-> implement functionalities specific to raspberry pi: network settings, smb control
-> group @config rules at top
-> chaining two or more remote motionEye cameras breaks updating configuration

-> browser compatibility test
